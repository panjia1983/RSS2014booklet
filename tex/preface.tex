We welcome you to Robotics: Science and Systems 2013 at the Technische Universit\"at in the exciting city of Berlin!  We sincerely hope you will enjoy this week with exciting scientific contributions from all around the world in a city with an extraordinary and unique history.

Regarding this program booklet, we decided to go all electronic this year to be able to provide you with as much information as possible in a convenient manner. You can find schedules and detailed information online on the conference's homepage. We created a new mobile site for the \href{http://www.roboticsproceedings.org}{conference proceedings} of this and past RSS. In addition, we provide you with a USB stick that contains everything you need at the conference: from the daily schedules, venue maps, conference papers, and talk abstracts to lunch places and tips for evening activities.

   This booklet contains the basic information you will need for attendance, but we encourage you to use the electronic version!
}{
   This booklet and the links contained in it will be your central hub for information regarding conference papers, wireless network configuration, and many other things...

This year's RSS was made possible by many invisible hands that gave their support and put in long hours and hard work: the organizing committee, our sponsors, the area chairs, the many reviewers, workshop chairs, our resident graphic designer, the student volunteers, and so many more. Special thanks to everybody who contributed!

If we can help you with anything during the conference, please just contact us---we wear light blue T-shirts!  You can also always reach the registration desk at {\Large \textbf{ +49 163 697 6268} or +49 163 69-ROBOT}.  At the registration desk you will also find paper pads and pens, power adapters, Aspirin, lunch tips, transportation help, a boarding pass printer, and other useful things...

We hope you will actively participate in the scientific discourse throughout the coming days and will leave Berlin with new insights, memories of exciting discussions, inspiring talks, brilliant ideas as well as new collaborators and friends!
